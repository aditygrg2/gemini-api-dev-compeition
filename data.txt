It might be a static electric shock. It occurs more often when the weather is dry, and the intensity of the shock differs by people.
Make sure the outlet connected to the refrigerator is grounded.
What should I do if my unit is cycling too often?
There could be buildup of dust/debris around condenser coils. Clean the condenser coils.
Check the user manual of the refrigerator to find the exact location of the condenser as it may vary by brand and model.
Turn OFF the refrigerator.
Remove the dust with a vacuum cleaner set to low or a soft brush.
Set the refrigerator temperature at or below 4 degrees Celsius.
What should I do if my refrigerator is not cooling properly?
1. Temperature may be set too high. Adjust the thermostat to a lower temperature and load in the refrigerator. Check if the issue persists after 4 hours.
2. Sensor that controls the freezer temperature could be being blocked -
Remove any blockage (food, debris) from around the sensor.
Make sure air is permitted to flow freely.


Thick ice formation could be acting like insulation -
Turn OFF the refrigerator.
Defrost the freezer overnight to fix the issue.


Check the ambient temperature. Refrigerators are designed to operate with ambient temperature of lower than 43 degrees Celsius.
There could be accumulation of dust on the condenser coils. Clean the condenser coils.

Allow the refrigerator to adjust to the new settings for 24 hours.
Avoid excessive opening and closing of the refrigerator during that time.
What should I do if the water is leaking inside my refrigerator?
This could be because the Refrigerator is positioned incorrectly. Water (actually condensation) is supposed to run from inside the refrigerator into a drain hole, and then into a drip pan underneath, where it evaporates. If the refrigerator is completely level or tipped slightly forward, the water will not be able to flow into the pan.
Adjust the front legs of the refrigerator so that it tips back slightly. The tilt also makes the door swing closed after you turn away from the refrigerator.
It can be a due to the defrost drain.
Locate the drain tubes at the rear of the refrigerator or freezer.
Push a small plastic tube or a pipe cleaner through the tubes.
Pour a mild solution of soapy water to kill bacteria.
Refrigerator is not cleaned. Refer to question XX for solution.
What should I do if the water is leaking from the back of my refrigerator?
Remove the water filter and reinstall it. Refer to user manual of the refrigerator for instructions as the method may vary as per brand and model.
Defrost drain is clogged.
Unplug the refrigerator and pull it away from the wall.
Open the refrigerator and locate the drain hole (typically found at the bottom. Refer to the user manual for if you have difficulty finding the drain hole for your particular model.

Locate the drain pan under your refrigerator in which the drain tube empties.
Remove the refrigerator's front grill plate.
Place a towel at the base of the fridge to catch any spills.
Clean the pan of any other residue, and return it to its original position.
Replace the front grill plate and plug in the refrigerator.
Push the refrigerator back into its spot.


What should I do if my refrigerator is making unusual noises?
The evaporator fan could be faulty. Check if the noise is coming from the freezer area.
Make sure the condenser fan is clean and spinning freely. To do so:
Unplug the fridge. Refer to the user manual of the refrigerator to find the exact location of the condenser fan.
Clean the fan blades with a clean, dry cloth.
Spin the fan by hand to check if it's stuck.
Plug in the fridge and check if the noise has stopped.


The timer could be faulty. The defrost timer is located at the bottom of the refrigerator near the front.
The compressor could be faulty. Check if the noise if coming from the back of the fridge where the compressor is located.
Check if the drain pan under the fridge is loose. Remove the drain pan. Secure the drain pan back in place and check if the issue is resolved.
Note: Sometimes there are certain operational sounds that a refrigerator can make and are no cause for concern. No troubleshooting is required in such cases.
If the following sounds are observed, it is normal. Popping sounds can be heard when pipes and the internal evaporator in the refrigerator compartment expand and contract as the temperature changes during the refrigerator operation.
A "clunk" sound can be heard sometimes from the vibration of the motor and piston in the compressor when it starts and finishes.
When the refrigerator stops, a water flowing sound may be heard. This sound occurs when liquid vapor refrigerant flows from the evaporator to the compressor.
What should I do if my refrigerator door does not open or close properly?
Check inside the refrigerator to ensure there aren't any food containers, open crisper drawers or misaligned shelves that could keep the door from closing properly.
Clean the refrigerator door gaskets with warm, soapy water and a soft cloth. You could make a mixture with 1 quart of warm water and 1 tbsp of baking soda to clean the gasket.

What should I do if there is a bad smell in the refrigerator?
Clean the inside compartments of the refrigerator with a clean, wet towel frequently.
Keep some orange or lemon sheets in the refrigerator. You could also deodorize with freshly ground coffee or baking soda. Leave an open container of baking soda in the fridge to absorb refrigerator smell for at least 24 hours.
Make sure food is cooled to room temperature before refrigerating food.
What should I do if the ice-cream is too soft even when in the freezer?
Adjust temperature control to maximum setting.
Put the freezer control knob at maximum position.
Let the refrigerator operate for 24 hours after adjustment to check if temperature falls.
Repeat until the freezer is cold enough.
Avoid placing the refrigerator in an area with direct sunlight
What should I do if the freezer is not cold enough?

Easy Monthly Installments (EMI)
How does Debit EMI work?
Debit EMI is a new EMI method. The bank won't block your card and you don't need the full amount in your account to transact. Your bank will deduct the monthly EMI from your account using the pre-approved overdraft facility.
Currently, Only HDFC, SBI, Axis, ICICI, Federal, and Kotak Mahindra debit cards offer EMI.
To avail EMI, you need to make a minimum purchase of ₹3000 using HDFC, ₹5000 using ICICI, Federal, Axis, and Kotak Mahindra cards, and ₹8000 using SBI.
Click here for debit EMI eligibility and information.
Why no-cost EMI charges interest?
For EMI purchases using credit & debit card, your bank will charge you interest. However, under a no-cost EMI offer, the total interest payable, is already adjusted in the price of the order.
The total payable amount (including interest) will be equal to the product price.
Know more about no cost EMI click here.
How does Down Payment work?
It is a payment option on select products, where you can pay 25% of the product price during purchase and convert the balance into EMI on your credit card.
You will have to pay the down payment and the first EMI in the next billing cycle of your credit card. For example, if you have made a purchase of ₹18000 on 9 months no-cost EMI using Down Payment, then initially your bank will block your credit limit by ₹18000. You will have to pay the one-time Down Payment of ₹4500 (25% of the product price) and the first monthly instalment of ₹1500 in the next billing cycle of your credit card. The blocked amount will come down to ₹12000. You will have to pay the remaining EMI of ₹1500 each for 8 months.
Note: Down Payment option is available only on select credit cards and select products that are equal to or more than ₹4000 and on. Please check the EMI options section on the product detail page to know if the product is eligible for Down Payment.
